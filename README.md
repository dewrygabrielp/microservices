# MicroServices

Microservices are not any type of specific technology, for example my knowledge focuses on amazon web services which is a technology that provides microservices.

Microservices is a series of practices, organization of work and equipment to build large-scale software more efficiently and quickly.

To understand the architecture of microservices I had to emphasize the software life cycle that with agile methodologies such as scrum, this iterative process is carried out in each module at all stages of the software, from birth to delivery

It is also good to remember that in monolithic systems we had a single database, a single repository, a single deployment of the entire system, the technology is maintained from start to finish (does not vary)

This results in the appearance of more bugs, unmaintainable maintenance and more complicated to add more functionality and this is where microservices come in.


the goal of microservices is to divide the system into closed contexts and we create a microservice for each context.

Micro refers to scope in functionalities, there is no standard to hoard how big they can be.

each microservice will live independently from the others having a single database, single repository, technology most suitable for said context and its deployment is independent, I don't know if some of those who are reading this readme.md have experience with aws or azure, I recommend you learn about these technologies to better understand this architecture set up
